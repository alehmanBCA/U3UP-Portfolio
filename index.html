                        I was born in Snellville Georgia in 2007. My family and I moved
                         to Oxford MS in 2010 and lived there until November 2024. We now live
                         in Water Valley MS. I graduated from Lafayette High School and currently
                         attend a non profit coding camp called Base Camp Coding Academy
                         located in Water Valley. My goal with this program is to be able to learn
                         full stack development with the hope of finding a full stack development job.
                         During my free time, I enjoy playing video games and I am very passionate
                         when it comes to bowling.

                        My Circuit Street was created in order to help employees and
                        employers at a computer store. Our project took inspiration and
                        therefore functions similarly to the Walmart app used by employees.
                        My Circuit Street allows for employees at the store to be able to
                        track the price and location of any and all items in the store with
                        ease. It also allows for employers/managers to check the status
                        (clocked in/clocked out) of employees at the store, which is very
                        helpful for determining things such as pay.

                        My Circuit Street was created using the programming
                        language Python and the GUI Toolkit Tkinter. Tkinter
                        is what was used to create the visual aspect of our
                        website, it is responsible for everything that you see
                        on the screen. Python is the language that was used
                        in order to make everything actually work such as
                        adding items and prices to the site.
