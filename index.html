                        I was born in Snellville Georgia in 2007. My family and I moved
                         to Oxford MS in 2010 and lived there until November 2024. We now live
                         in Water Valley MS. I graduated from Lafayette High School and currently
                         attend a non profit coding camp called Base Camp Coding Academy
                         located in Water Valley. My goal with this program is to be able to learn
                         full stack development with the hope of finding a full stack development job.
                         During my free time, I enjoy playing video games and I am very passionate
                         when it comes to bowling.
